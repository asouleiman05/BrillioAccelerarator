title: Deploying the Payment Transfer App
description: Instructions to deploy the React-based CBPR+ Payment Transfer app using AWS Amplify.
---

In this section, you‚Äôll deploy your **React-based CBPR+ Payment Transfer** application to the cloud using **AWS Amplify**. Once deployed, the app will be accessible through a public web URL and ready to initiate real payment transfers through the Aplonhub Brillio API.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- ‚úÖ AWS account with admin permissions
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with your application code or build artifacts for your application
- ‚úÖ Application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- ‚úÖ API environment ready (e.g. `https://aplonhub-brillio.pc14.eu`)
- ‚úÖ Environment variable: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://aplonhub-brillio.pc14.eu`

## üß≠ Deployment Approaches

This workshop supports multiple ways to deploy your React app using AWS Amplify. Choose the one that fits your setup:

---

### üîó **Approach 1: Deploy via GitHub Repository**

## üß≠ Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### üîó Step 1: Connect Repository to AWS Amplify

1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).
2. Click **"Create new app"**.
3. Choose source code provider (e.g., GitHub). Click **"Next"** and authorize Amplify.

4. Select your repo and branch (e.g., `main`).

5. Click **"Next"**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: App Settings - Advanced Settings

Add Environment Variable

1. Go to App Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables.
2. Add the following:
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://aplonhub-brillio.pc14.eu
3. Click **"Next"**.
   ![Amplify Screen3](/static/images/amplify3-screen.png)

This environment variable is used in your app to connect to the Aplonhub CBPR+ API.

### üöÄ Step 4: Deploy the App

1. After Review click **"Save and Deploy"**.

2. Amplify will:

- Clone your repo
- Install dependencies
- Build the app
- Host it on a public URL

This process may take a few minutes.

### üåç Step 5: Access Your Application

Once deployment is complete, you‚Äôll get a live URL like:

https://main.<your-app-id>.amplifyapp.com

Visit this URL to open your deployed payment transfer application.

### üîÅ Step 6: Continuous Deployment

Every push to the connected Git branch (e.g. main) will:

- Automatically trigger a rebuild
- Redeploy the latest version of your app
- No need to redeploy manually for every change!

### üì¶ **Approach 2: Deploy via S3 (Build Folder Upload)**

This approach is useful when you don't want to connect a Git provider. If you have a build folder ready from running npm run build, you can:

### üîó Step 1: Upload your React app build folder to an S3 bucket. [Download Build](/assets/build.zip)

### üîó Step 2: Go to AWS Amplify Console > Create New App > Deploy without Git > Click **"Next"**.

![Amplify5 Screen](/static/images/amplify5-screen.png)

### üîó Step 3: Provide App name and Choose "Amazon S3" as the method.

### üîó Step 4: Click on Browse S3 and Provide S3 location of objects to host by Selecting the S3 bucket containing your build output.

![Amplify6 Screen](/static/images/amplify6-screen.png)

### üîó Step 5: Click Save and Deploy.

### üåç Step 6: Access Your Application

Once deployment is complete, you‚Äôll get a live URL like:

https://staging.<your-app-id>.amplifyapp.com

Visit this URL to open your deployed payment transfer application.

### üì¶ **Approach 3: Deploy via S3 + AWS CloudFormation Template**

This approach is useful when setting up infrastructure as code (IaC) for reproducible environments. You can automate your deployment by uploading a source ZIP + CloudFormation template to S3, then launching a stack in the CloudFormation Console.

### üîó Step 1: Upload the following to an S3 bucket:

react-app-source.zip (excluding node_modules) [Download Source Code](/assets/source-code.zip)

template.yaml (CloudFormation template that references the ZIP) [Download cloudformation-template.yaml](/assets/cloudformation-template.yaml)
