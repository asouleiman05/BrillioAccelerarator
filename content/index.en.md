The AWS Payment Accelerator is a pre-configured solution that helps developers quickly build and deploy secure, scalable payment applications on AWS. It includes best practices, sample code, and integration patterns for processing payments via APIs.

It provides a fast way to launch a React-based application that integrates with CBPR+ APIs for sending outgoing payments, verifying transactions, and monitoring them using tools like Aplon Hub, all hosted and managed through AWS Amplify.
