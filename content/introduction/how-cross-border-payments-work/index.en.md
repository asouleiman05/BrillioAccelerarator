Cross-border payments enable financial institutions, businesses, and individuals to send money between different countries and currencies. These transactions power global commerce, international payroll, remittances, and supplier payments — and are increasingly expected to be **instant**, **transparent**, and **traceable**.

Modern cross-border payments leverage standards such as **SWIFT MT**, **ISO 20022**, and regional schemes (e.g., **TARGET2**, **MEPS**, **SEPA**, **FedNow**) to exchange payment instructions and confirmations between originating and beneficiary banks.

Unlike domestic real-time payments (like RTP or FedNow), cross-border transactions often involve **multiple intermediaries**, currency conversions, and compliance checks (e.g., AML, sanctions screening). However, innovations in payment hubs like **aplonHUB™** and smart orchestration tools enable faster, more reliable execution.

Whether it’s a corporate sending funds to a global supplier or an individual remitting money to family abroad, the core flow includes:

- **Payment initiation** from the sender's institution
- **Message transformation and validation** (e.g., SWIFT to ISO 20022)
- **Routing through intermediary banks or a correspondent network**
- **Currency conversion**, if required
- **Compliance checks** at each hand-off
- **Funds delivery** to the recipient's bank account

Brillio Payment Solution powered by Payment Components simplifies this complexity by centralizing message routing, transforming formats, and integrating with AML and compliance systems. It supports end-to-end processing with real-time monitoring and alerting for cross-border flows.

> As demand for faster, traceable, and lower-cost international payments grows, platforms like aplonHUB™ — with native ISO 20022 support and Finaplo.AI for intelligent message analysis — are helping financial institutions deliver seamless cross-border payment experiences.

In this workshop, we simulate a **cross-border transaction** using a simple UI and the aplonHUB™ REST API. You'll be able to view the transaction in the aplonHUB Dashboard and trace each step in the payment lifecycle.
